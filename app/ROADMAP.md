Future features
- Deploy shipping dev specifying branch
- Create special user that creates discussions to avoid using own user. Perhaps github app?
We want to avoid needing every user to authorize the app.


Internal
- Change docker image tag for twisted
- Create a global config objet that initializes on app startup and is cached.
- Add middleware for error handling
- Add middleware for auth
