# Future features
- Add command to deploy certain branch to shipping dev
- Create special user that creates discussions to avoid using own user. Perhaps github app?
We want to avoid needing every user to authorize the app.

# Improvements
- Enable healthcheck endpoint 
- Try load balancer for real web apps
- Add middleware for auth (user id repo of valid users)
